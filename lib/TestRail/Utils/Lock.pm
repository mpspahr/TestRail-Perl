=head1 NAME

TestRail::Utils::Lock - Pick high priority cases for execution and lock them via the test results mechanism.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.043

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lock a test case via usage of the test result field.
Has a hard limit of looking for 250 results, which is the only weakness of this locking approach.
If you have other test runners that result in such tremendous numbers of lock collisions,
it will result in 'hard-locked' cases, where manual intervention will be required to free the case.

However in that case, one would assume you could afford to write a reaper script to detect and
correct this condition, or consider altering your run strategy to reduce the probability of lock collisions.

=head2 pickAndLockTest(options,[handle])

Pick and lock a test case in a TestRail Run, and return it if successful, confess() on failure.

testrail-lock's primary routine.

=over 4

=item HASHREF C<OPTIONS> - valid keys/values correspond to the long names of arguments taken by L<testrail-lock>.

=item TestRail::API C<HANDLE> - Instance of TestRail::API, in the case where the caller already has a valid object.

There is a special key, 'mock' in the HASHREF that is used for testing.
The 'hostname' key must also be passed in the options, as it is required by lockTest, which this calls.

Returns a HASHREF with the test, project, run and plan (if any) definition HASHREFs as keys.
Also, a 'path' key will be set which has the full path to the test on disk, if match mode is passed, the case title otherwise.

If the test could not be locked, 0 is returned.

=back

=head2 lockTest(test,lock_status_id,handle)

Lock the specified test, and return it's title (or full_title if it exists).

=over 4

=item HASHREF C<TEST> - Test object returned by getTests, or a similar method.

=item INTEGER C<LOCK_STATUS_ID> - Status used to denote locking of test

=item TestRail::API C<HANDLE> - Instance of TestRail::API

=back

Returns -1 in the event a lock could not occur, and warns & returns 0 on lock collisions.
